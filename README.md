# Handwritten-digit-classification
A simple handwritten digit classification using neural networks.
MNIST dataset is used for training and testing the model.
The training data consist of 6000 images(28 x 28 pixel szie) and their corresponding labels while the testing data contains 10000 images and their labels. The model gives an accuracy about 96%. This project will be a helpful one for beginners who is enthusiastic about learing neural networks.
